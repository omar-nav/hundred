# hundred
Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of 3, instead of the
number, print "Multi". For multiples of 5 print "IT". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5,
print "Multipli".
But here's the catch: you can use only one `if`. No multiple branches, ternary operators or `else`.
Requirements
● 1 if
● You can't use `else`, `else if` or ternary
● Unit tests
● We are big fans of JS and Node.JS.
